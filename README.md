# Analysis scripts and tabulated data 
* figures-and-stats: scripts for statistical analysis and figure plotting
* reparam-DBS: run of specparam for movement disorders dataset
* reparam-sEEG: run of specparam for epilepsy dataset
* senstivity-analysis-DBS: fitting range sensitivity analysis for movement disorders dataset
* sensitivity-analysis-sEEG: fitting range sensitivity analysis for epilepsy dataset

Note that paths within scripts will need to be updated and some zip files decompressed.
